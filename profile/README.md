- **Duplicate DML Operation**: Prevent duplicate database operations between screens.
- **Hardcoded Id**: Remove hardcoded ID's to eliminate data dependencies.
- **Flow Naming Convention**: Establish a naming convention for better findability and consistency.
- **Missing Flow Description**: Include descriptions to document flow usage and purpose.
- **Missing Fault Path**: Customize error handling with a Fault Path to handle flow failures.
- **Missing Null Handler**: Validate data by checking for non-null results in Get Records operations.
- **SOQL Query In A Loop**: Consolidate SOQL queries to avoid governor limit issues.
- **Unconnected Element**: Avoid unconnected elements to maintain flow efficiency.
- **Unused Variable**: Remove unused variables for better flow manageability.
